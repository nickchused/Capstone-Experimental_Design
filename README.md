This project analyzes data gathered by NASA on the change in global temperatures over the past 140 years.  The focus of the project is determining if these changes could potentially be due to chance fluctuations, or if the phenomenon of global warming is virtually undeniable.

To explore this question I examined combined annual global land-surface air and sea-surface water temperature anomalies (GISTEMP) from 1880 to 2016, as deviations from the corresponing 1951 to 1980 temperature means.

This topic is extremely relevant today given the controversial threat of global warming that scientists and politicians alike argue about today. Anyone interested in debating the existence of global warming, or in considering the threat it may pose to the future of our planet, benefits from this research.
